## Overview

ArchType started as an experiment in making actual product design simpler and more accessible. Traditional tools felt too complex for quick iterations, so I built something lighter that still maintained the visual quality designers expect.

## The Problem

Most product design tools require extensive training and don't support real-time collaboration. After learning more on graphics programming, I wanted to create a platform where designers could quickly prototype ideas and get instant feedback from clients or team members and also make it SUPEEERRRRRRR EASYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY TO USE.

## Stage

ArchType is currently in it's MVP development stage, with a public beta planned for Q3 2026.
