## Overview

The Stadium Player Card system is a dynamic solution for generating unique SVG-based cards for players and teams participating in tournaments. Each card encapsulates vital statistics and performance metrics, providing a comprehensive overview of a player's or team's worth for recruitment and ownership purposes. This system is designed to enhance the gaming experience by offering a collectible aspect similar to traditional trading cards, but tailored for the esports community — think of it as a pokemon card but for gamers.
